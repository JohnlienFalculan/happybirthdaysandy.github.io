                    <h1>Aphrodite by The Ridleys</h1>
                    <p>"I see the galaxies when I look in your eyes" - I see the colors that brighten up anyone's day the moment I look into her eyes, sometimes I can't speak at all. When I saw her eyes
                        for the first time in person, they were glowing. I can't explain how stunning it was. She just gave of this aura and then it all started from that.

                    <p>"She is a girl I met one January noon" - it's funny that the song aligned because we met in person on January and also she was on a book store that time. The song was about uncertainty and caution. I kept telling
                        myself before that "No, don't fall for it" but guess who did. I am a troubadour and my feet were meant to roam, but when I heard her voice I longed for home.

I just wanna figure out love with you." - We might not yet know what love actually is and it's alright. I'll just be here to figure it out with her whatever the ending might be. I'm gonna work on myself while she also does. I want to be more of a shelter and less of a storm.</p>

                        Oh look, it's our first date. I look like a typical nerd classmate here with the hair and she. Oh I remember this day, this was when I gave her the 
                        butterfly bracelet inspired by Daniel Ceasar's song "Best Part". I was glad that she liked it because at first, I wasn't sure if she listens
                        to DC. This was also the day that I realized that she has the smile. I can't describe it yet at that time so maybe next time.

                    Pretty eyes and nice smile combo and the way it sparkles makes it so precious and brighter than the all the 
                    stars in the sky especially when she's excited about things. The way she smiles makes my day brighter every time.

                        She frequently catches me stealing a glance at her eyes, but I am not sure if she notices because I always say,
                        "Wala lang" when she asks me why. I might look zoned out, but who knows? Maybe it's just me getting lost in her eyes.
                        If she would ask me what my favorite feature to see from her is, it's her smile and eyes. Her eyes always catch me off guard; it's her eyes that sparkle like the stars in a night sky.

                        Disclaimer: I apologize na agad for using this photo<br> 
                        I said I loved her eyes and smile last time so this time, let's talk about her personality. She has this goofy yet sweet side, but sometimes maangas na personality. Our humor somehow matched when we first talked and met.
                        She can talk to me about stoopid things and she is also open to deep talks. She has a lot of sides to her that I want to know more about. 
                        When she says something stupid, but I just fall even harder for her (that's crazy, she is also). She giggles when she laughs din and it's cute.
                        She's also strong and tough. Nagaaya siya lagi ng sapakan HAHA.

                        personality I have. Sinasabayan pa nya ako with my stupid ideas, but sinasaway niya ako when I see someone who looks like Peter Griffin. She also
                        judges me agad kapag I smile and there is someone around na she is sus that I am laughing about in my mind. Maybe
